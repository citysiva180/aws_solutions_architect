EC2 at solutions architect level 

---------------------------
    Public vs Private IP
---------------------------

- network ids are 2 different options 

    - IPV4 - 3.7 billion ids are already created and devices are talking with each other 
    - IPV6 - used for IOT 

Private IP vs Public IP 

Computers usually talk with each other with ips. Now when these are public, 
we could see that they could communicate with their address in the internet 

While in a private network, the ips which are white listed will only communicate 
with each other. 

Public Ip : 

- Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet 
- Must be unique across the whole web 
- Can be geo located easily 

Private IP 

- Private IP means the machine can only be identified on a private network. 
- the ips must be unique across \the private network. 
- But 2 different private networks can have the same ips 
- Machines connect to WWW using a NAT +  Internet gateway (a proxy)
- Only specified range of ips could be used as an Private IP 

---------------------------
    Public vs Private IP
---------------------------

- When you stop an then start an Ec2 Instance it can change its public IP 
- If you need to have a fixed public IP for your instance, you need an Elastic IP 
- An Elastic IP is a Public IPv4 IP you own as long as you don't delete it 
- You can attach it to one instance at a time 

- With an elastic IP address you can mask the failure of an instance or a software by rapidly 
remapping the address to another instance in your account 
- you can only have only 5 elastic IP in your account(you can ask AWS to increase that)

- Overall try to avoid using Elastic IPs: 

- They often reflect poor architectural decisions 
- Instead use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it 
- Or else could use a Load Balance and don't use the public IP


When you stop and start (reboot) an Amazon EC2 instance, its public IP address is not guaranteed to remain the same. 
By default, the public IP address of an EC2 instance is released when you stop it and is assigned a new public IP 
address when you start it again. This behavior is because the public IP address is associated with the instance's network 
interface, which can change when the instance is stopped and started.

This can cause issues if you rely on the instance having a consistent public IP address, especially if you're using 
that address for public-facing services or if you've whitelisted the IP address for certain purposes.

To maintain a consistent public IP address across instance stop/start cycles, you can use an Elastic IP (EIP). 
An Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address that you can allocate to your AWS account. You can then associate 
the Elastic IP with an EC2 instance. 

Elastic IPs are specifically used for EC2 instances and provide a consistent public IP address for your instances, 
which is particularly useful when you need a static IP.
Dedicated IPs might refer to IP addresses associated with specific AWS-managed services (like network load balancers 
or NAT gateways), where AWS takes care of IP management.
In summary, Elastic IPs are used for providing consistent public IP addresses to EC2 instances, whereas the term 
"dedicated IP" might refer to IP addresses associated with specific AWS-managed services that AWS provisions 
and manages for you.

---------------------------
    Placement Groups! 
---------------------------

Placement groups discusses how the Ec2 instances are placed in the data center. 
Now the placement could be of three types 

- Cluster placement groups
- Spread placement group 
- Partition Placement group 

Cluster partition groups :  They are low latency groups available in a single Availability zone 

- All instances are in the same group and rack 
- Low latency bandwidth 
- However there is an increased risk of failure if 1 fails 
- Use case 
    - big data jobs 
    - Application that needs extremely low latency and high network throughput 


Spread Placement groups - Instances are spread across the underlying hardware. Max is 7 instances per Availability Zone

- All instances are spread in different hardware. Unlike cluster, all these are distributed in different areas
- This decreases the changes of failure 
- It could also span on multiple availability zones 
- However the limitation is that only 7 instances could be chosen this way
- Use case : 
    - high availability
    - Critical Applications where each instance must be isolated from failure from each other

Partitioned Placement Groups:  Spreads instances across many partitions which rely upon different sets of racks 
within an availability zones. Scales to 100s of Ec2 instances per group! use case is for Hadoop, casandra and Kafka 

- A Partition will represent a rack in aws availability zone. 
- It could span across 7 partitions per availability zone 
- Up to 100 ec2 instances could be spanned per partition 
- The entire rack is dedicated available for your application. meaning there is no sharing of rack 
- Incase of any failure the ec2 instances will be affecting for that rack only. Not to other racks! 
- All the information on the partition could be easily accessed
- Usually the use cases are HDFS, HBase, Cassandra and Kafka 

---------------------------
 Elastic Network Interface 
---------------------------

- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card!

-  The ENI can have the following attributes 
    - Primary IPV4 which is private 
    - One or more secondary IPV4 
    - One Public IPV4 
    - A Mac Address and 
    - A Security group!

- You can create an ENI independently and attach them on the fly on Ec2 instances for Failover
- Bound to a specific availability zone (AZ)
