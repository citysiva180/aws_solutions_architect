   Amazon RDS - Relational Database 
------------------------------------------

- RDS Stands for Relational Database Service 
- It's managed DB service for DB use SQL as a Query Language 
- It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS 
- It includes 
    - Postgres 
    - MySql 
    - MariaDB 
    - Oracle
    - Microsoft SQL Server 
    - Aurora - AWS Proprietary database 

- RDS is a managed Service 

    - Automated Provisioning, OS Patching 
    - Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp 
    - Monitoring Dashboards 
    - Read Replicas for improved read Performance 
    - Multi-AZ setup for DR 
    - Maintenance Window for Upgrades 
    - Scaling Capability 
    - Storage backed by EBS - gp2 or iol 

But you can't SSH into your instances

- Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically 
- When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically 
- Avoid manually scaling your database storage 
- You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (Maximum Limit for DB Storage)
- Automatically modify storage if: 
    - Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage 
    - Low-Storage lasts at least 5 minutes 
    - 6 hours have passed since last modification 
- Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads 
- Supports all RDS database Engines ( Maria DB, MySQL, PostgresSQL, SQLServer and Oracle)

RDS Read Replicas

Read Replicas for Read Scalability: 



Read Replicas improves and scales the reading capabilities of the database 
Remember : Read Replicas have Async Replication by which they are always ib synch!

- Understand the difference between read replicas and Multi-zone AZ 
- Read replicas helps you to scale your reads. Meaning these replicas are optimized for reading which is much 
faster in read speed 

- You could create up to 15 read replicas 
- Within AZ, cross AZ or Cross Region 
- Replication is ASYNC so reads are eventually consistent 
- Replicas can be promoted to their on DB 
- Applications must update the connection string to leverage read replicas 

Example use case : 

- You have a production database which takes a normal load 
- you want to run a reporting application to run some analytics 
- You create a Read replica to run the new workload there 
- The production application is unaffected 
- Read Replicas are used for SELECT (=read) only kind of statements 
(not INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Network Cost associated with RDS Read Replicas 

- In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another 
- for RDS Read Replicas within the same region you don't pay that fee

    Same region but different availability zones - free 
    Different region and Different availability zones - Cost 

RDS Multi-AZ Disaster Recovery 

- SYNC Replication 
- One DNS name - automatic app failover to standby 
- Increase Availability 
- Failover in case of loss of AZ, loss of network, instance 
or storage failure 
- No Manual Intervention in apps 
- Not used for scaling 

RDS - From Single-AZ to Multi-AZ 

- Zero Downtime operation - no need to stop the DB 
- Just click on modify for the database 
- The following 

RDS Custom Options 

- Managed Oracle and MS SQL Server Database with OS and Database Customization 
- RDS: Automates setup, operation and scaling of database in AWS 
- Custom :  access to the underlying database and OS so you can 
    - configure settings
    - Install patches 
    - Enable native features 
    - Access the underlying Ec2 Instance using SSH or SSM Session Manager 
- De-activate the automation mode to perform your customization, better to take a DB 
snapshot before as well. 

RDS vs RDS Custom 
    - RDS - Entire Database is managed by AWS 
    - RDS Custom :  full admin access to the underlying OS and the Database 

Amazon Aurora 

- Aurora is a proprietary technology from AWS - not open sourced 
- Postgres and MySQL are both supported as Aurora DB 
- Aurora is "AWS cloud Optimized and claims 5x performance improvement over 
MySQL nd RDS over 3x the performance of Postgres on RDS 
- Aurora storage automatically fro in increments of 10GB up to 128 TB 
- Aurora can have up to 15 replicas and the replication process is faster than MySQL (sub 10 ms replica )
- Failure in Aurora is instantaneous. It's HA native | This basically means, your database is restored instantaneously!
- Aurora costs more than RDS - 20% more but its more efficient 

Remember : Aurora has api endpoints for reading and writing. Reading endpoints connect to all read replicas 

Aurora High Availability and Read Scaling 

- 6 copies of your data across AZ 
    - 4 copies out of 6 needed for writes 
    - 3 copies out of 6 needed for reads 
    - self-healing with peer-to-peer replication 
    - storage is striped across 100s of volumes 

- One Aurora Instances takes writes 
- Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds 
- Master + up to 15 aurora read replicas serve reads 
- Support for cross region replication 

Features of Aurora 

- Automatic fail-over 
- Backup and Recovery 
- Isolation and Security 
- Industry compliance 
- Push-button scaling 
- Automated Patching with Zero Downtime 
- Advanced Monitoring 
- Routing Maintenance 
- Backtrack: restore data at any point of time without using backups 

Features of Aurora in Detail 

- Aurora Custom Endpoints 

    - Read and Write replicas have their own functionality to increase performance 
    - there are multiple read replicas with a load balancer which reduces your latency in reading from Aurora database. 
    - With this you also could have a custom endpoint to your database. 
    - Using the Custom Endpoints you could run your analytical queries on your database 
    - Define a subset of Aurora Instances as a Custom Endpoints 
    - Example : Run analytical queries on specific endpoints 
    - The Reader Endpoints is generally not used after defining Custom Endpoints 

- Aurora Serverless 

    - Automated database instantiation and Autoscaling based on Actual Usage 
    - Good for infrequent intermittent or unpredictable workloads 
    - No capacity planning 
    - Pay per second can be more cost-effective 

- Aurora Multi-Master 

    - In case you want continuous write availability for the writer nodes 
    - Every node does R/W - vs promoting a Read Replicas as the new Master 

Global Aurora 

- Aurora Cross Region Read Replicas 

    - Useful for disaster recovery 
    - Simple to Put in Place 

- Aurora Global Database 

    - 1 Primary Region (read/write)
    - Up to 5 secondary (read-only) regions, replication lag is less than 1 second 
    - Up to 16 Read Replicas per secondary region 
    - Helps fro decreasing Latency 
    - promoting another region has an RTO of < 1 minutes
    - Typical Cross-Region replication takes less than 1 second 

- Aurora Machine Learning Instances 

    - Enable you to add ML-based Predictions to your applications via sql 
    - Simple, optimized and secure integration between Aurora and AWS ML Services 
    - Supported Services 
        - Amazon Sage Maker - use with any ML Model 
        - Amazon Comprehend 
    - You don't need to have ML Experience 
    - Use case: fraud detection, ads targeting, sentiment analysis, product recommendations 

- RDS Backups 

    - Automated Backups 
        - Daily full backup of the database 
        - Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes 
        - => Ability to restore to ay point in time 
        - 1 to 35 days of retention, set 0 to disable automated backups 


    - Manual DB Snapshots 
        - Manually triggered by the user 
        - Retention of Backup for as long as you want 

    - Trick in a stopped RDS Database, you will still pay for the storage. If you plan on stopping it 
    for a long time, you should snapshot and restore instead

- Aurora Backups 

    - 1 to 35 days - cannot be disabled 
    - Point in time recovery in that time frame 

- Manual DB Snapshots 
    - Manual triggered by the user 
    - Retention of backup for as long as you want 

- RDS and Aurora Restore Options 

    - Restoring a RDS / Aurora backup or a snapshot creates a new database 

- Restoring MySQL RDS Database from S3 

    - Create a backup of your on-premises database 
    - Store it on backup file onto a new RDS instance running MySQL 

- Restoring MySQL Aurora Cluster From s3 

    - Create a backup of your on-premises database using Percona XtraBackup 
    - Store the backup file on Amazon S3 
    - Restore the backup file onto a new Aurora Cluster running MySQL 

Aurora Database Cloning 

    - Create a new Aurora DB Cluster from an Existing one 
    - Faster than Snapshot and Restore 
    - Uses copy-on-write protocol 
        - Initially, the new DB Cluster uses the same data volume as the original 
        - When updates are made to the new DB cluster data, then additional storage is allocated and the data 
        is copied to be separated 

    - Very fast and Cost-Effective 
    - Useful to create a "staging" database from a "production" database without 
    impacting the production database 

RDS and Aurora Security 

- At rest encryption 

    - Database master and replicas encryption using AWS KMS - Must be defined as launch time 
    - If the master is not encrypted, the read replicas cannot be encrypted 
    - To encrypt an un-encrypted database, go through a DB Snapshot and Restore as encrypted 

Amazon RDS proxy 

- Fully managed database proxy for RDS 
- Allows apps to pool and share DB Connections established with the database 
- Improving database efficiency by reducing the stress on database resources and minimize open connections 
- Serverless, autoscaling, highly available - Multi-AZ 
- Reduced RDS and Aurora Failover time by up 66%
- Supports RDS 
- No code changes required for most apps 
- Enforce IAM authentication for DB and securely store credentials in AWS Secrets manager. 
- RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible - must be access via VPC 

AWS Elastic Cache Overview 

- The same way RDS is to get managed Relational Databases... 
- ElastiCache is to get managed Redis or Memcached 
- Caches are in-memory databases with really high performance, low latency 
- Helps reduce load off of databases for read intensive workloads 
- Helps make your application stateless 
- AWS takes care of OS Maintenance / patching, optimization, setup, 
configuration, monitoring, failure recovery and backups 
- Using Elastic cache Involves in heavy application code change  

ElastiCache Solution Architecture - User Session Store 

- User logs into any of the application 
- The Application writes the session data into ElastiCache 
- The User hits another instance of our application 
- The instance retrieves the data and the user is already logged in 

ElastiCache  - Redis vs Memcached 

Redis 

- Multi-AZ with Auto-Failover 
- Read Replicas to Scale reads and have high availability 
- Data durability using AOF persistance 
- Backup and Restore features 
- Supports sets and sorted set sorts 

Memcached 

- Multi-node for partitioning of data
- No high availability - replication 
- Non Persistent 
- No backup and restore 
- Multi-threaded architecture 

ElastiCache - Cache Security 

- ElasticCache supports IAM Authentication for Redis 
- IAM Policies on ElastiCache are only used for AWS API-Level security 
- Redis AUTH 

    - You can set a "password/token" when you create a Redis Cluster 
    - This is an Extra level of security for your cache - on the top of security groups 
    - Support SSL in flight encryption 

- Memcached 
    - Supports SASL-Based Authentication - advanced 

Patterns for ElastiCache 

- Lazy Loading: All the read data is Cached, data can become stale in cache 
- Write through: Adds or Update data in the cache when written to a DB 
- Session Store: Store temporary session data in a cache 

ElastiCache - Redis Use Case: 

- Gaming leader boards are computationally complex 
- Redis Sorted Sets guarantee both uniqueness and element ordering 
- Each time a new element is added, its ranked real time and then added in correct order..
